# Pizza Sales Analysis - July 2024

Welcome to the **Pizza Sales Analysis** project, where I explore, clean, and analyze sales data from a pizza chain. This project showcases my skills in SQL for data extraction, Power BI for visualization, and data analysis techniques to derive actionable insights for business decisions.

## üîç Overview

This project focuses on understanding the sales performance of a pizza chain over a period of time. The key objectives of this analysis are:
- Extracting and cleaning sales data.
- Aggregating sales metrics and conducting time series analysis.
- Visualizing performance using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## üìä Key Components

### 1. **Data Extraction & Cleaning**
- Utilized SQL to extract sales data from the database.
- Removed duplicates, standardized formats, and ensured data consistency for accurate analysis.

### 2. **Data Transformation & Analysis**
- Aggregated data to compute key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and sales by product type.
- Conducted time series analysis to detect seasonal trends, helping to identify peak sales periods and potential growth opportunities.

### 3. **Dashboard Creation**
- Designed an interactive dashboard in **Power BI** to visualize overall sales performance, product trends, and seasonal patterns.
- The dashboard helps in tracking KPIs like total revenue, orders per month, and best-selling pizza types.
